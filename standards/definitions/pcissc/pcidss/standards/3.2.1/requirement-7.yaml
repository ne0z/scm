        description: "Examine written policy for access control, and verify that the policy incorporates 7.1.1 through 7.1.4 as follows:
        
        • Defining access needs and privilege assignments for each role
        • Restriction of access to privileged user IDs to least privileges necessary to perform job responsibilities
        • Assignment of access based on individual personnel’s job classification and function
        • Documented approval (electronically or in writing) by authorized parties for all access, including listing of specific privileges approved.
        "
        description_note: ""
    guidance: "The more people who have access to cardholder data, the more risk there is that a user’s account will be used maliciously. Limiting access to those with a legitimate business reason for the access helps an organization prevent mishandling of cardholder data through inexperience or malice.

            description_note: ""
        guidance: "In order to limit access to cardholder data to only those individuals who need such access, first it is necessary to define access needs for each role (for example, system administrator, call center personnel, store clerk), the systems/devices/data each role needs access to, and the level of privilege each role needs to effectively perform assigned tasks. Once roles and corresponding access needs are defined, individuals can be granted access accordingly.

            "
            description_note: ""
        guidance: "When assigning privileged IDs, it is important to assign individuals only the privileges they need to perform their job (the “least privileges”). For example, the database administrator or backup administrator should not be assigned the same privileges as the overall systems administrator.
        
        Assigning least privileges helps prevent users without sufficient knowledge about the application from incorrectly or accidentally changing application configuration or altering its security settings. Enforcing least privilege also helps to minimize the scope of damage if an unauthorized person gains access to a user ID.
