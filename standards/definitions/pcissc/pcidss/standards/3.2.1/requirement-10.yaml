        guidance: "Checking logs daily minimizes the amount of time and exposure of a potential breach.
        
        Daily review of security events—for example, notifications or alerts that identify suspicious or anomalous activities—as well as logs from critical system components, and logs from systems that perform security functions, such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, file-integrity monitoring (FIM) systems, etc. is necessary to identify potential issues. Note that the determination of “security event” will vary for each organization and may include consideration for the type of technology, location, and function of the device. Organizations may also wish to maintain a baseline of “normal” traffic to help identify anomalous behavior.
