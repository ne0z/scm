    guidance: "There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits, often called \"zero day\" (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability), against otherwise secured systems. Without an anti-virus solution that is updated regularly, these new forms of malicious software can attack systems, disable a network, or lead to compromise of data.

            description_note: ""
        guidance: "Typically, mainframes, mid-range computers (such as AS/400) and similar systems may not currently be commonly targeted or affected by malware. However, industry trends for malicious software can change quickly, so it is important for organizations to be aware of new malware that might affect their systems—for example, by monitoring vendor security notices and anti-virus news groups to determine whether their systems might be coming under threat from new and evolving malware.
        
        Trends in malicious software should be included in the identification of new security vulnerabilities, and methods to address new trends should be incorporated into the company's configuration standards and protection mechanisms as needed

    Audit logs provide the ability to monitor virus and malware activity and anti-malware reactions. Thus, it is imperative that anti-malware solutions be configured to generate audit logs and that these logs be managed in accordance with Requirement 10.

    guidance: "Anti-virus that continually runs and is unable to be altered will provide persistent security against malware.
    
    Use of policy-based controls on all systems to ensure anti-malware protections cannot be altered or disabled will help prevent system weaknesses from being exploited by malicious software.
    
    Additional security measures may also need to be implemented for the period of time during which anti-virus protection is not active—for example, disconnecting the unprotected system from the Internet while the anti-virus protection is disabled, and running a full scan after it is re-enabled.
