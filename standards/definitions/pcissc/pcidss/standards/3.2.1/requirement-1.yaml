    guidance: "Firewalls and routers are key components of the architecture that controls entry to and exit from 
    the network. These devices are software or hardware devices that block unwanted access and manage 
    authorized access into and out of the network.

    Configuration standards and procedures will help to ensure that the organization’s first line of defense 
    in the protection of its data remains strong.

            "
            description_note: ""
        guidance: "Compromises often happen due to unused or insecure service and ports, since these often have known vulnerabilities and many organizations don’t patch vulnerabilities for the services, protocols, and ports they don't use (even though the vulnerabilities are still present). By clearly defining and documenting the services, protocols, and ports that are necessary for business, organizations can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed.

        Approvals should be granted by personnel independent of the personnel managing the configuration.

        If insecure services, protocols, or ports are necessary for business, the risk posed by use of these protocols should be clearly understood and accepted by the organization, the use of the protocol should be justified, and the security features that allow these protocols to be used securely should be documented and implemented. If these insecure services, protocols, or ports are not necessary for business, they should be disabled or removed.

        For guidance on services, protocols, or ports considered to be insecure, refer to industry standards and guidance (e.g., NIST, ENISA, OWASP, etc.).
