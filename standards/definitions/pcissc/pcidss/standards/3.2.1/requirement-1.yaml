    guidance: "
    Firewalls and routers are key components of the architecture that controls entry to and exit from 
    the network. These devices are software or hardware devices that block unwanted access and manage 
    authorized access into and out of the network.

    Configuration standards and procedures will help to ensure that the organization’s first line of defense 
    in the protection of its data remains strong.

        guidance: "
        A documented and implemented process for approving and testing all connections and changes 
        to the firewalls and routers will help prevent security problems caused by misconfiguration 
        of the network, router, or firewall.
          
        Without formal approval and testing of changes, records of the changes might not be updated, 
        which could lead to inconsistencies between network documentation and the actual configuration.

        Network diagrams describe how networks are configured, and identify the location of all network devices.
          
        Without current network diagrams, devices could be overlooked and be unknowingly left out of 
        the security controls implemented for PCI DSS and thus be vulnerable to compromise.
