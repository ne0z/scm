    guidance: "
      Firewalls and routers are key components of the architecture that controls entry to and exit from the network. These devices are software or hardware devices that block unwanted access and manage authorized access into and out of the network.

      Configuration standards and procedures will help to ensure that the organization’s first line of defense in the protection of its data remains strong.

               Identify a sample of actual changes made to firewall and router configurations, compare to the change records, and interview responsible personnel to verify the changes were approved and tested.

            description_note: ""
        guidance: "
          A documented and implemented process for approving and testing all connections and changes to the firewalls and routers will help prevent security problems caused by misconfiguration of the network, router, or firewall.
          
          Without formal approval and testing of changes, records of the changes might not be updated, which could lead to inconsistencies between network documentation and the actual configuration.

            description_note: ""
        guidance: "
          Network diagrams describe how networks are configured, and identify the location of all network devices.
          
          Without current network diagrams, devices could be overlooked and be unknowingly left out of the security controls implemented for PCI DSS and thus be vulnerable to compromise.
