        description_note: ""
    guidance: "A risk assessment enables an organization to identify threats and associated vulnerabilities with the potential to negatively impact their business. Examples of different risk considerations include cybercrime, web attacks, and POS malware. Resources can then be effectively allocated to implement controls that reduce the likelihood and/or the potential impact of the threat being realized.
    
    Performing risk assessments at least annually and upon significant changes allows the organization to keep up to date with organizational changes and evolving threats, trends, and technologies.
