    guidance: "Communicating password/authentication policies and procedures to all users helps those users understand and abide by the policies.
    
    For example, guidance on selecting strong passwords may include suggestions to help personnel select hard-to-guess passwords that don’t contain dictionary words, and that don’t contain information about the user (such as the user ID, names of family members, date of birth, etc.). Guidance for protecting authentication credentials may include not writing down passwords or saving them in insecure files, and being alert for malicious individuals who may attempt to exploit their passwords (for example, by calling an employee and asking for their password so the caller can “troubleshoot a problem”).
    
    Instructing users to change passwords if there is a chance the password is no longer secure can prevent malicious users from using a legitimate password to gain unauthorized access.
