        guidance: "Allowing vendors to have 24/7 access into your network in case they need to support your systems increases the chances of unauthorized access, either from a user in the vendor’s environment or from a malicious individual who finds and uses this always-available external entry point into your network. Enabling access only for the time periods needed, and disabling it as soon as it is no longer needed, helps prevent misuse of these connections.
        
        Monitoring of vendor access provides assurance that vendors are accessing only the systems necessary and only during approved time frames.

        The re-authentication can be applied either at the system level to protect all sessions running on that machine, or at the application level.
