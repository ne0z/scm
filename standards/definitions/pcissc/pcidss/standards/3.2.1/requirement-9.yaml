        guidance: "When investigating physical breaches, these controls can help identify the individuals that physically accessed the sensitive areas, as well as when they entered and exited.
        
        Criminals attempting to gain physical access to sensitive areas will often attempt to disable or bypass the monitoring controls. To protect these controls from tampering, video cameras could be positioned so they are out of reach and/or be monitored to detect tampering. Similarly, access control mechanisms could be monitored or have physical protections installed to prevent them being damaged or disabled by malicious individuals.

        Examples of sensitive areas include corporate database server rooms, back-office rooms at retail locations that store cardholder data, and storage areas for large quantities of cardholder data. Sensitive areas should be identified by each organization to ensure the appropriate physical monitoring controls are implemented.

        Securing storage containers used for materials that are going to be destroyed prevents sensitive information from being captured while the materials are being collected. For example, “to-be-shredded” containers could have a lock preventing access to its contents or physic ally prevent access to the inside of the container.
        
        Examples of methods for securely destroying electronic media include secure wiping, degaussing, or physical destruction (such as grinding or shredding hard disks).

        guidance: "If steps are not taken to destroy information contained on hard disks, portable drives, CD/DVDs, or paper prior to disposal, malicious individuals may be able to retrieve information from the disposed media, leading to a data compromise. For example, malicious individuals may use a technique known as “dumpster diving,” where they search through trashcans and recycle bins looking for information they can use to launch an attack.
