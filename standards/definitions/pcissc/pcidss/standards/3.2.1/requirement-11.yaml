    guidance: "Implementation and/or exploitation of wireless technology within a network are some of the most common paths for malicious users to gain access to the network and cardholder data. If a wireless device or network is installed without a company’s knowledge, it can allow an attacker to easily and “invisibly” enter the network. Unauthorized wireless devices may be hidden within or attached to a computer or other system component, or be attached directly to a network port or network device, such as a switch or router. Any such unauthorized device could result in an unauthorized access point into the environment.
    
    Knowing which wireless devices are authorized can help administrators quickly identify non- authorized wireless devices, and responding to the identification of unauthorized wireless access points helps to proactively minimize the exposure of CDE to malicious individuals.
    
    Due to the ease with which a wireless access point can be attached to a network, the difficulty in detecting their presence, and the increased risk presented by unauthorized wireless devices, these processes must be performed even when a policy exists prohibiting the use of wireless technology.
    
    The size and complexity of a particular environment will dictate the appropriate tools and processes to be used to provide sufficient assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been installed in the environment.

    For example: In the case of a single standalone retail kiosk in a shopping mall, where all communication components are contained within tamper-resistant and tamper-evident casings, performing a detailed physical inspection of the kiosk itself may be sufficient to provide assurance that a rogue wireless access point has not been attached or installed. However, in an environment with multiple nodes (such as in a large retail store, call center, server room or data center), detailed physical inspection is difficult. In this case, multiple methods may be combined to meet the requirement, such as performing physical system inspections in conjunction with the results of a wireless analyzer.

Additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being addressed.
    
    For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that four quarters of passing scans be completed if the assessor verifies 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented policies and procedures requiring quarterly scanning, and 3) vulnerabilities noted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-scan(s). For subsequent years after the initial PCI DSS review, four quarters of passing scans must have occurred.

        description_note: ""
    guidance: "A vulnerability scan is a combination of automated or manual tools, techniques, and/or methods run against external and internal network devices and servers, designed to expose potential vulnerabilities that could be found and exploited by malicious individuals.
    
    There are three types of vulnerability scanning required for PCI DSS:
    
    • Internal quarterly vulnerability scanning by qualified personnel (use of a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) is not required)
    • External quarterly vulnerability scanning, which must be performed by an ASV
    • Internal and external scanning as needed after significant changes
    
    Once these weaknesses are identified, the entity corrects them and repeats the scan until all vulnerabilities have been corrected.
    Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in a timely manner reduces the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and potential compromise of a system component or cardholder data.

        guidance: "An established process for identifying vulnerabilities on internal systems requires that vulnerability scans be conducted quarterly.
