    description: "Always change vendor-supplied defaults and remove or disable unnecessary default accounts before installing a system on the network.
    
    This applies to ALL default passwords, including but not limited to those used by operating systems, software that provides security services, application and system accounts, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, payment applications, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings, etc.).

        • All vendor defaults (including default passwords on operating systems, software providing security services, application and system accounts, POS terminals, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings, etc.) are changed before a system is installed on the network.
        • Unnecessary default accounts (including accounts used by operating systems, security software, applications, systems, POS terminals, SNMP, etc.) are removed or disabled before a system is installed on the network.

        description_note: ""
    guidance: "Malicious individuals (external and internal to an organization) often use vendor default settings, account names, and passwords to compromise operating system software, applications, and the systems on which they are installed. Because these default settings are often published and are well known in hacker communities, changing these settings will leave systems less vulnerable to attack.
    
    Even if a default account is not intended to be used, changing the default password to a strong unique password and then disabling the account will prevent a malicious individual from re-enabling the account and gaining access with the default password.

        guidance: "If wireless networks are not implemented with sufficient security configurations (including changing default settings), wireless sniffers can eavesdrop on the traffic, easily capture data and passwords, and easily enter and attack the network.
        
        In addition, the key-exchange protocol for older versions of 802.11x encryption (Wired Equivalent Privacy, or WEP) has been broken and can render the encryption useless. Firmware for devices should be updated to support more secure protocols.
