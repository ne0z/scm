        guidance: "Mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized loss of clear-text PAN may include appropriate tools—such as data loss prevention (DLP) solutions—and/or manual processes and procedures. Coverage of the mechanisms should include, but not be limited to, e-mails, downloads to removable media, and output to printers. Use of these mechanisms allows an organization to detect and prevent situations that may lead to data loss.

            guidance: "Attempts to remove clear-text PAN via an unauthorized channel, method, or process may indicate malicious intent to steal data, or may be the actions of an authorized employee who is unaware of or simply not following the proper methods. Timely investigation of these occurrences can identify where remediation needs to be applied and provides valuable information to help understand where the threats are coming from."
