        guidance: "A formal compliance program allows an organization to monitor the health of its security controls, be proactive in the event that a control fails, and effectively communicate activities and compliance status throughout the organization.
        
        The PCI DSS compliance program can be a dedicated program or part of an over-arching compliance and/or governance program, and should include a well-defined methodology that demonstrates consistent and effective evaluation. Example methodologies include: Deming Circle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), ISO 27001, COBIT, DMAIC, and Six Sigma.
        
        Maintaining and monitoring an organization’s overall PCI DSS compliance includes identifying activities to be performed daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually, and ensuring these activities are being performed accordingly (for example, using a security self-assessment or PDCA methodology).
        
        Examples of strategic business decisions that should be analyzed for potential PCI DSS impacts may include mergers and acquisitions, new technology purchases, or new payment- acceptance channels.

        guidance: "Personnel responsible for PCI DSS compliance have specific training needs exceeding that which is typically provided by general security awareness training. Individuals with PCI DSS compliance responsibilities should receive specialized training that, in addition to general awareness of information security, focuses on specific security topics, skills, processes, or methodologies that must be followed for those individuals to perform their compliance responsibilities effectively.
        
        Training may be offered by third parties—for example, SANS or PCI SSC (PCI Awareness, PCIP, and ISA), payment brands, and acquirers— or training may be internal. Training content should be applicable for the particular job function and be current to include the latest security threats and/or version of PCI DSS.
        
        For additional guidance on developing appropriate security training content for specialized roles, refer to the PCI SSC’s Information Supplement on Best Practices for Implementing a Security Awareness Program.
