    guidance: "A formal data retention policy identifies what data needs to be retained, and where that data resides so it can be securely destroyed or deleted as soon as it is no longer needed.
    
    The only cardholder data that may be stored after authorization is the primary account number or PAN (rendered unreadable), expiration date, cardholder name, and service code.
    
    Understanding where cardholder data is located is necessary so it can be properly retained or disposed of when no longer needed. In order to define appropriate retention requirements, an entity first needs to understand their own business needs as well as any legal or regulatory obligations that apply to their industry, and/or that apply to the type of data being retained.

    Identifying and deleting stored data that has exceeded its specified retention period prevents unnecessary retention of data that is no longer needed. This process may be automated or manual or a combination of both. For example, a programmatic procedure (automatic or manual) to locate and remove data and/or a manual review of data storage areas could be performed.
    
    Implementing secure deletion methods ensure that the data cannot be retrieved when it is no longer needed.

For example, if only the last four digits are needed to perform a business function, mask the PAN so that individuals performing that function can view only the last four digits. As another example, if a function needs access to the bank identification number (BIN) for routing purposes, unmask only the BIN digits (traditionally the first six digits) during that function.

    One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values.
    
    The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored.
    
    An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key.
    
    The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or \"home- grown\" algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.
    
    By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value. Controls that prevent the correlation of this data will help ensure that the original PAN remains unreadable.

        guidance: "The intent of this requirement is to address the acceptability of disk-level encryption for rendering cardholder data unreadable. Disk-level encryption encrypts the entire disk/partition on a computer and automatically decrypts the information when an authorized user requests it. Many disk- encryption solutions intercept operating system read/write operations and carry out the appropriate cryptographic transformations without any special action by the user other than supplying a password or pass phrase upon system startup or at the beginning of a session. Based on these characteristics of disk-level encryption, to be compliant with this requirement, the method cannot:
        
        1) Use the same user account authenticator as the operating system, or
        
        2) Use a decryption key that is associated with or derived from the system’s local user account database or general network login credentials.
