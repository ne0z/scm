    description: "Establish a process to identify security vulnerabilities, using reputable outside sources for security vulnerability information, and assign a risk ranking (for example, as “high,” “medium,” or “low”) to newly discovered security vulnerabilities.
    "
    description_note: "Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score, and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
    
    Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk- assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a “high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered “critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.

        description_note: ""
    guidance: "The intent of this requirement is that organizations keep up to date with new vulnerabilities that may impact their environment.
    
    Sources for vulnerability information should be trustworthy and often include vendor websites, industry news groups, mailing list, or RSS feeds.
    
    Once an organization identifies a vulnerability that could affect their environment, the risk that the vulnerability poses must be evaluated and ranked. The organization must therefore have a method in place to evaluate vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis and assign risk rankings to those vulnerabilities. This is not achieved by an ASV scan or internal vulnerability scan, rather this requires a process to actively monitor industry sources for vulnerability information.
    
    Classifying the risks (for example, as “high,” “medium,” or “low”) allows organizations to identify, prioritize, and address the highest risk items more quickly and reduce the likelihood that vulnerabilities posing the greatest risk will be exploited.

        • That applicable critical vendor-supplied security patches are installed within one month of release.
        • All applicable vendor-supplied security patches are installed within an appropriate time frame (for example, within three months).
        "
        description_note: ""
    guidance: "There is a constant stream of attacks using widely published exploits, often called \"zero day\" (an attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability), against otherwise secured systems. If the most recent patches are not implemented on critical systems as soon as possible, a malicious individual can use these exploits to attack or disable a system, or gain access to sensitive data.
    
    Prioritizing patches for critical infrastructure ensures that high-priority systems and devices are protected from vulnerabilities as soon as possible after a patch is released. Consider prioritizing patch installations such that security patches for critical or at-risk systems are installed within 30 days, and other lower-risk patches are installed within 2-3 months.
    
    This requirement applies to applicable patches for all installed software, including payment applications (both those that are PA-DSS validated and those that are not).

            description_note: ""
        guidance: "Security vulnerabilities in custom code are commonly exploited by malicious individuals to gain access to a network and compromise cardholder data.
        
        An individual knowledgeable and experienced in code-review techniques should be involved in the review process. Code reviews should be performed by someone other than the developer of the code to allow for an independent, objective review. Automated tools or processes may also be used in lieu of manual reviews, but keep in mind that it may be difficult or even impossible for an automated tool to identify some coding issues.
        
        Correcting coding errors before the code is deployed into a production environment or released to customers prevents the code exposing the environments to potential exploit. Faulty code is also far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments.
        
        Including a formal review and signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance with policies and procedures.
